## Principles 

1. **Identity** Any given object is identified with a unique and web-resolvable identifier.

2. **Meaning** The meaning of all data concepts must be expressed at their most finely grained level as mathematical statements and in machine-readable form. 

3. **Federation** Facts about any given object may be stored in many physical respositories. Facts are accessed using W3C (internet-based) protocols. 

4. **Context** Inconsistencies exist about facts amongst the same object stored in various repositories [What??]

5. **Measurable** The quality of data, ontologies, definitions and business rules in a set of named graphs must be measurable.  

6. **Usability** Objects, facts, ontologies, definitions and business rules must be presented in language that resonate with SMEs.

7. **Transformation** Mappings must be automated and executable for data at rest and data in motion including via virtual access.
